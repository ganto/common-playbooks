#*  This playbook downloads, unpacks, and installes our customized liferay
#* packages. It will also connect the container and the #* database - both
#* must be already installed (see below).
#*  Note: this playbook should be used either from the main install playbook
#* (which resolves its dependencies) or as a shorthand for an already set up
#* system, where the dependencies are already provided.
#*  Use '-a' to pass parameters to ansible (as '-e'). See ansible fetch for
#* details.
#*  No arguments are mandatory.
