#* This playbook wrappes the fetch module. It passes the websites
#* configured for the host as a list to 'src'. Use '-a' to pass
#* further parameters to ansible (as '-e'). See ansible fetch for
#* details. 
#* You might want to do a noteify merge-all first and then merge
#* manually (for the moment..) back to the storage dir.
